# RealtimeNetworkScan
## What is it?
Its a script to simply scan your network using NMap.
On startup you have to chooose one of the currently
available Interfaces, after that it updates in realtime
which hosts are up.

## Problems:
(Maybe somebody could help fixing them)
1. It doesnt work on windows because fcntl is not available for windows
